# Wedding App

The Wedding App (working title) is a personal project that I am pursuing. I aim to keep it open-source and welcome any contributions to enhance it.

## The Idea

The aim of the app is to simplify event organisation and guest management while providing a social platform for event participants. The app will allow users to manage RSVPs, gather guest information, and engage the guests through various communication and entertainment features.

Current apps that manage RSVPs and provide social engagement opportunities often have limitations, such as being tied to specific social networks or not offering user data ownership. The Wedding App aims to provide a more efficient solution for event organization and will include gamification elements to encourage platform use.

## Features

The final product will feature:
- Event management and communication tools
- Guest and RSVP management, including automated invitation dispatch and data extraction in CSV format
- In-app messaging and posting capabilities
- Photo and video upload options
- Gamification elements to encourage user engagement
